This is a Next.js application for managing food bank inventory, donations, and allocations.

## Core Features

- **Dashboard**: An overview of key metrics like donation volume, active recipients, and expiring items.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, view, and manage food items with detailed information and status tracking.
- **AI-Powered Recipient Matching**: Uses GenAI to suggest the best recipients for a given food item based on various factors.
- **Role-Based Simulation**: Switch between different user roles (Admin, Staff, Donor, Recipient) to see how the UI adapts.

## Getting Started

1.  The application will start on the **Dashboard**.
2.  Explore the **Dashboard** for an overview of operations.
3.  Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Inventory** page to see all food items.
4.  Click on an item in the table to view its details. On the details page, you can use the **AI Recipient Matching** feature.
5.  Use the **Add Item** button on the inventory page to create new food donations.
6.  Use the **Role Switcher** in the header to simulate different user perspectives (this is a demonstration and does not provide real authentication).
