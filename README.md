# PantryLink

A real-time food distribution platform that connects donors, food banks, and recipients to solve the hunger-waste paradox. While 47 million Americans face food insecurity, 63 million tons of edible food is wasted annually. This isn't a scarcity problem; it's an information problem. Our platform enables donors to instantly post surplus food, food banks to manage inventory with smart expiration tracking, and recipients to see real-time availability at nearby pantries. By creating transparency across the entire supply chain, we're transforming coordination chaos into seamless connection. The result: 20-30% reduction in food waste and zero wasted trips to empty pantries.

## Core Features

- **Dashboard**: An overview of key metrics like donation volume, active recipients, and expiring items.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, view, and manage food items with detailed information and status tracking.
- **AI-Powered Recipient Matching**: Uses GenAI to suggest the best recipients for a given food item based on various factors.
- **Role-Based Simulation**: Switch between different user roles (Admin, Staff, Donor, Recipient) to see how the UI adapts.
